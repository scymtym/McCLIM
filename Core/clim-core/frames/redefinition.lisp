;;; Update application frame instance when application frame class is
;;; redefined.

(in-package #:clim-internals)

;;; Frame class redefinition notification protocol
;;;
;;; This is used for notifying application frame classes after aspects
;;; such as the class itself, the `generate-panes' method or the
;;; command table have been redefined. The notification sequence
;;; begins with a call to `note-frame-class-redefined' which either
;;; directly calls `handle-frame-class-redefinition' or schedules the
;;; call to be made when leaving a
;;; `with-delayed-redefinition-notifications'.
;;;
;;; This protocol is probably most commonly initiated by re-evaluating
;;; the `define-application-frame' form that defined the frame class
;;; in question, but any event that causes the `reinitialize-instance'
;;; method of the class to execute also triggers it. In the context of
;;; `define-application-frame',
;;; `with-delayed-redefinition-notifications' delays the
;;; `note-frame-class-redefinition' call until after all aspects
;;; (`generate-panes' method, command table definition, etc) have been
;;; executed.
